				<h1>ISSUES > AFFORDABLE HOUSING	</h1>

				There can be little doubt that housing in the Bay Area and Mountain View specifically has reached levels that are unaffordable to many.  
				Renters and new home buyers are well aware of the problem, but even long time home owners ask:  "Could I buy my house today?" or "Will my 
				children be able to afford living in the same community they grew up in?"  Usually, the answer to both of these question is No. 
				<br><br>
				Housing has become so expensive that long time residents have had to move away, leaving friends and family.  Yet, many of these same people 
				still work in our community and now have to spend hours on the freeway getting to and from work. This worsens area traffic, places an unbearable 
				burden on those who have to suffer through it daily and significantly increases carbon emissions.
				<br><br>
				I have been a vocal advocate of affordable housing and was a leading proponent of the Below Market Rate housing program, the Housing Impact Fee, 
				and the efficiency studio apartment project at San Antonio Place.  These programs make more affordable housing available in the community because 
				housing developers provide 10% of the units in a new development at prices affordable to people like teachers, police officers, fire fighters and 
				others.  Commercial Developers help create affordable housing opportunities through the Housing Impact Fee by paying a small fee for new commercial 
				development which brings with it more employees, which increase the demand for housing.
				<br><br>	
				Mountain View MUST NOT become a community where only the well-to-do can afford to live.  I want our teachers, firefighters, store clerks, children and others to be able to live in this wonderfully diverse community.  To make that happen, we must continue to explore creative and collaborative ideas so that those who want to live and work here are able to do so.  It is the diversity of our community that makes Mountain View unique, and we MUST work hard to preserve that which makes us great.
