					<h1>
						ISSUES &gt; PARKS AND OPEN SPACE</h1>
					Mountain View is the envy of many in the Bay Area because of our parks and open space. We are fortunate to have had the foresight many years ago to develop and maintain Shoreline, Rengstorff and Cuesta Parks, our many neighborhood parks and the highly prized Stevens Creek Trail. Yet despite such wonderful community assets, many neighborhoods continue lack adequate park space.<br />
					<br />
					Because Mountain View is essentially fully developed, the only way to get new parkland is to buy it, yet the price of land keeps going up. I have advocated changing the formula the City uses to collect park construction fees so that it more realistically represents how many new people will live in a housing development. I also support and have been working towards the development of a new community park in the area of town most deficient in open space, the Whisman area. This will not be an easy park to develop because there is limited land available for purchase, and it will be very expensive. In fact, it may be necessary to seek approval from the voters before such a project could ever be successful, but we will never know unless we try.<br />
					<br />
					We must also be sure the Stevens Creek Trail gets fully funded so that it extends from one end of the City to the other. Likewise, it has been determined that Cuesta Park Annex is a vital link in protecting over 1000 homes in Mountain View from a 100 year flood.&nbsp; In collaboration with the Water District, a shallow basin will be formed in a part of the annex that will not impact any of the exisiting oaks.&nbsp; The added topography will make the natural surroundings more enjoyable and useable by more or our residents, without turning the annex into developed and manicured park space.&nbsp; At the same time, over 1000 homeowners in Mountain View will no longer be required to pay for federal flood insurance.<br />
